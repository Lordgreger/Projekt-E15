\section{Abstract}
This project demonstrates how to create at chat application using C++. The computers using the application must be able to communicate with DTMF tones and a communication protocol must be dessigned.
The created application also includes a login and user history feature.
\newline
Agile software development, in partucular Scrum, has been used to simplify our project challenges by dividing them into smaller issues.
\newline
The created software is divided into layered softwarearchitecture by using datacommunication layers, such as the physical layer, the data link layer, the transportation layer and the application layer. Our main issues were solved by using: Goertzel for efficient tone recognition, CRC for error detection in data packages and Stop-and-Wait for establishing a connection between two processes.
